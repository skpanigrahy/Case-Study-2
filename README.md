# Case-Study-2
I got to learn a lot while solving the questions in this Case Study. The data was stored in 6 tables including;
* runners table
* customer_orders table
* runner_orders table
* pizza_names table
* pizza_recipes table
* pizza_toppings table

CASE STUDY QUESTIONS

The case study questions are broken up into 4 areas of focus including:
* Pizza Metrics
* Runner and Customer Experience
* Ingredient Optimizations
* Pricing and Ratings
